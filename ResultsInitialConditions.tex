The lake water added to the experiment initially (10 June 2014), had 0.034, 0.084, and 0.008 mg L\textsuperscript{-1} of NO\textsubscript{2}--N + NO\textsubscript{3}--N, NH\textsubscript{4}--N, and ortho-phosphate, respectively. The bottles enriched with DIN and DIP had 0.184, 0.195, and 0.012 mg L\textsuperscript{-1} NO\textsubscript{2}--N + NO\textsubscript{3}--N, NH\textsubscript{4}--N, and ortho-phosphate, respectively.
