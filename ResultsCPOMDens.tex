\subsection{Sediment Organic Matter Density}

The density of leaf litter in the ponds ranged between 3.44 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-1}. The greatest leaf litter densities were found in Daulton Pond and Lancer Park Pond but in both cases the greatest densities were rather exceptional values (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). The mean leaf litter density (natural log transformed) differed among the ponds (F\textsubscript{3, 38} = 3.955, p = 0.015). The greatest leaf litter density was found in Lancer Park Pond with a mean ($\pm$ SD) density of 398.7 ($\pm$ 435.9) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}. However the leaf litter density of Lancer Park Pond was only significantly different from Woodland Court pond which had a mean density of ($\pm$ SD) of 36.0 ($\pm$ 55.4) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}. The mean ($\pm$ SD) leaf litter density of Daulton Pond and Wilkes Lake were 175.4 ($\pm$ 343.5) and 147.8 ($\pm$ 194.1) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}), respectively and were not significantly different than the other ponds. 

In all the ponds, the greatest leaf litter densities were found in the littoral portion of the pond (Fig \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). Across all the ponds leaf litter density of the littoral portions of the ponds ranged between 9.71 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} with a mean ($\pm$ SD) density of 283.1 ($\pm$ 346.9) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}, which is significantly greater (F\textsubscript{1, 40} = 28, p < 0.0001) and much more variable than the leaf litter density of the open areas of the ponds, which ranged between 3.44 and 214.9, with a mean ($\pm$ SD) density of 29.3 ($\pm$ 47.9) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). 

The percent sediment organic matter of Wilkes Lake was significantly lower than any of the other ponds but there were no differences among the other ponds (F\textsubsript{3, 37} p = 0.001) nor between the open and littoral sections of the pond (F\textsubscript{1, 39}, = 0.963, p = 0.333), or with the density of leaf litter (r\textsuperscript{2} = 0.0046, p = 0.714)(Fig. \ref{fig:LOI_survey}).
