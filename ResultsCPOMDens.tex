\subsection{Sediment Organic Matter Density}

The density of leaf litter in the ponds ranged between 3.44 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-1}. The greatest leaf litter densities were found in Daulton Pond and Lancer Park Pond but in both cases the greatest densities were rather exceptional values (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). The greatest median leaf litter density was found in Lance Park Pond (220.6 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}), followed by Daulton Pond (37.5 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}), Wilkes Lake (24.7 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}), and Woodland Court (10.7 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}). 

In all the ponds, the greatest leaf litter densities were found in the littoral portion of the pond (Fig \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). Across all the ponds leaf litter density of the littoral portions of the ponds ranged between 9.71 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} with a median density of 112.6 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}, which is greater and much more variable than the leaf litter density of the open areas of the ponds, which ranged between 3.44 and 214.9, with a median of 10.83 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). Lancer Park Pond had the greatest and most variable leaf litter density in both the open and littoral portions of the pond but this pond also had the fewest samples (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). 

The percent sediment organic matter in the ponds varies by pond but did not differ between the open and littoral sections of the pond nor with the density of leaf litter.
