\subsection{Sediment Organic Matter Density}

The density of leaf litter in the ponds ranged between 3.44 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-1}. The greatest leaf litter densities were found in Daulton Pond and Lancer Park Pond but in both cases the greatest densities were rather exceptional values (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). The mean natural log transformed leaf litter density differed among the ponds (F\textsubscript{3, 38} = 3.955, p = 0.015). The greatest leaf litter density was found in Lancer Park Pond with a mean ($\pm$ SD) density of 398.7 ($\pm$ 435.9) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}. However the leaf litter density of Lancer Park Pond was only significantly different from Woodland Court pond with a mean density of ($\pm$ SD) of 36.0 ($\pm$ 55.4) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}. The mean ($\pm$ SD) leaf litter density of Daulton Pond and Wilkes Lake were 175.4 ($\pm$ 343.5) and 147.8 ($\pm$ 194.1) g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}), respectively and were not significantly different than the other ponds. 

In all the ponds, the greatest leaf litter densities were found in the littoral portion of the pond (Fig \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). Across all the ponds leaf litter density of the littoral portions of the ponds ranged between 9.71 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} with a mean ($\pm$ SD) density of 112.6 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}, which is greater and much more variable than the leaf litter density of the open areas of the ponds, which ranged between 3.44 and 214.9, with a median of 10.83 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). 

The percent sediment organic matter in the ponds varies by pond but did not differ between the open and littoral sections of the pond nor with the density of leaf litter.
