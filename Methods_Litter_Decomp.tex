\subsection{Leaf Litter Decomposition}

To determine the leaf litter decomposition rate in the ponds, we incubated tulip poplar leaves that had been collected by gently pulling senescent leaves from the tree. Only leaves that released without resistance were used.  The leaves were all collected and air--dried during the fall of 2013.  The leaf packs were assembled by placing 5.0 g of the tulip poplar leaved into plastic produce bags with approximately 9 mm\textsuperscript{2} mesh. The bags were sealed and attached to a float and a small bag of rocks as an anchor.  The bags were placed into the littoral zone of
