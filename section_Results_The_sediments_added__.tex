\section{Results}

The sediments added to the mesocosms had an estimated dry bulk density that ranged between 0.25 to 0.26 g ml\textsuperscript{-1} and an organic matter content between 12.7 and 12.9\%. Using this information, we estimate that the sediments in the mesocosms contained between 3.16 and 3.33 g of organic matter.  The mesocosms that received leaf litter each received
