\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study Site}
Samples for the experiment were collected from Lancer Park Pond, a stormwater collection pond in Farmville, VA. The pond has a surface area of ~0.06 ha and a maximum depth of 1.5m. Field sediment samples were collected from the littoral zone on May 29, 2014, using an Ekman-Dredge. Half of the sediments were collected from a depth of 0.4m and the other half were collected from 1m depth. The sediments were sieved through a 250 µm mesh net and retained in buckets. Since, by definition, a “macroinvertebrate is any invertebrate that is 250 µm or larger,” the mesh net effectively eliminated macroinvertebrates from our sediment samples. The CPOM retained by the net was placed into 1 liter bottles. The retained CPOM would later be used to to determine the CPOM density of Lancer Park Pond and to give an estimate of the amount of CPOM to add to our BOD bottles. Water was collected from the pond at a depth of 0.5m on June 9, 2014.
