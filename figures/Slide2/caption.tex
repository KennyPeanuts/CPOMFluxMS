\label{fig:nut_flux}

Flux of inorganic nutrients across the sediment-water interface of the microcosms with (circles) and without (triangles) leaf litter. The open symbols indicate the flux for an individual microcosm and the solid symbols show the mean of the replicate microcosms. A negative flux indicates uptake by the sediments.  Note that the range of flux values differs for each nutrient.
