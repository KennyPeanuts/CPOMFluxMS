\label{fig:sod}

Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in the microcosms from the litter experiment (A) and the leached litter SOD experiment (B). Each open symbol represents SOD from a single microcosm on that day with (circles) or without (triangles) leaf litter. The closed symbols indicate the mean of each treatment in the litter experiment to show the day by treatment interaction.
