\subsection{Nutrient Flux}
\subsubsection{Nitrate + Nitrite}

Overall the change in DIN and DIP concentrations in the bottles was low and not affected by the presence of leaf litter or added nutrients (Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}).  The exceptions to this were the nitrate + nitrite flux which was significantly affected by the presence of leaf litter and the day of the incubation (Table \ref{tab:nut_anova}).  Additionally there was a significant interaction between leaf litter and incubation day, indicating that the effect of leaf litter was not consistent across all of the incubation days (Table \ref{tab:nut_anova}, Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}). On the second day of the incubation the bottles without leaf litter showed an increase in nitrate + nitrite that ranged 37.5 and 181.1 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1}, while the bottles with leaf litter showed essentially no change with a range of -2.4 to 2.9 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} (Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}).  A difference in the change in DIN between the bottles with and without leaf litter was also evident on day 7 but in on this day the bottles with leaf litter showed a greater increase in DIN (Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}). The change in DIN ranged -41.0 to 3.6 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} and -20.4 to 37.2 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} in the bottles lacking and with leaf litter, respectively.
