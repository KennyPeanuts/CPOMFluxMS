%NutrientFlux

\subsection{Nutrient Flux}

Overall the change in DIN and DIP concentrations in the bottles was low and the different nutrients varied in how they were affected by the duration of incubation and the presence of leaf litter or added nutrients (Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}).  The nitrate + nitrite flux was significantly affected by the presence of leaf litter and the day of the incubation (Table \ref{tab:nut_anova}). However, there was a significant interaction between leaf litter and incubation day, indicating that the effect of leaf litter was not consistent across all of the incubation days (Table \ref{tab:nut_anova}, Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}). On the second day of the incubation the bottles without leaf litter showed an increase in nitrate + nitrite that ranged 37.5 and 181.1 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1}, while the bottles with leaf litter showed essentially no net change with a range of -2.4 to 2.9 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} (Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}).  A difference in the change in nitrate + nitrite between the bottles with and without leaf litter was also evident on day 7 but the bottles with leaf litter showed a greater increase in nitrate + nitrite (Fig. \ref{fig:nut_flux}). The change in nitrate + nitrite on day 7 ranged -41.0 to 3.6 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} and -20.4 to 37.2 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} in the bottles lacking and containing leaf litter, respectively. 

The change in the ammonium concentration ranged from -4.6 to 7.4 mg N m\textsubscript{-2} d\textsubscript{-1} with a mean change of -0.69 mg N m\textsuperscript{-2} d\textsuperscript{-1} and was not affected by the days of incubation, or the presence of leaf litter or added nutrients (Table \ref{tab:nut_anova}, Fig. \ref{fig:nit_flux}).

The ortho--phosphate concentration showed a significant increase on days 2 and 7 of the incubation but was not
