\subsection{BOD Processing}
At each sampling, the BOD bottles were removed from incubation, and then approximately 68ml of water were drawn from the bottle. 2, 15 ml samples were collected with a glass syringe and placed in 10 ml vials. One vial was sealed and then fixed for Time 0 (T-0). The other sample was placed on the rocker-shaker to incubate in the dark for five hours. The final water collected was for bacterial, nutrient, and absorbence samples. The 3ml  bacterial samples were stored in a bacterial vial, preserved in gluteraldehyde in the fridge. The absorbance samples were stored in the refrigerator, while the nutrient samples were kept in the freezer. Bottles were set-up on 9 June 2014 and sampled on days 1 (10 June 2014),3, 8, 15, and 22. SOD was calculated as the change in dissolved oxygen over time. Dissolved oxygen was determined using the Winkler's Titration method. 

At the conclusion of the experiment, a sample for sediment C:N ratio and a sediment ergosterol sample were taken from each of the BOD bottles. In addition, in BOD bottles with CPOM, leaf disks were taken for C:N ratio samples and leaf ergosterol samples.
