\subsection{Dissolved Oxygen Concentration}

The dissolved oxygen concentration of the overlying water in the bottles ranged from 80.09 to 275.80 $\mu mols$ O\textsubscript{2} L\textsubscript{-1} with a median of 224.80 $\mu mols$ O\textsubscript{2} L\textsuperscript{-1}.  The dissolved oxygen concentration varied significantly over the course of the incubation and was the lowest on the initial day of the incubation (Fig. \ref{fig:DO_days}). Additionally, the bottles containing leaf litter had lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in the overlying water on day 0 and day 2 of the incubation (Fig. \ref{fig:DO_days}).
