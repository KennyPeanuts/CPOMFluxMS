\subsection{Incubation Experiment}

The BOD bottles were randomly assigned treatments. 100 ml of sediment slurry were added to each bottle, and then approximately 200 ml of water were added slowly so as not to disturb the sediments. There were 16 bottles in total: 4 bottles with ambient nutrients and no CPOM, 4 bottles with CPOM and ambient nutrients, 4 bottles with nutrient enriched water, and 4 bottles with CPOM and nutrient enriched water. CPOM treated bottles contained 20 leaf disks. Nutrient enriched water treatments were created by adding 300 micrograms L -1 of DIN and 30 micrograms L -1 of DIP to the ambient nutrient pond water. The BOD bottles were incubated in the dark, at room temperature, on rocker-shakers at speed 8 and tilt 8. To encourage gas exchange in the bottles, the bottles were stored with 15ml of water removed. Thus, the total water was approximately 185ml.
