%OM Quality

\subsection{Organic Matter Quality}

S\textsubset{R} ranged between 0.81 and 1.48 over the course of the experiment.  The linear mixed model found that there was a significant effect of the presence of leaf litter on S\textsubscript{R} (p < 0.0001) but this effect was not consistent throughout the incubation as indicated by a significant (p = 0.0002) interaction between leaf litter and incubation days. Evaluation of the results shows that the bottles containing leaf litter had a greater S\textsubscript{R} on the initial day of the incubation but after this, there was not difference in S\textsubscript{R} among the bottles (Fig. \ref{fig:sratio_day}).
