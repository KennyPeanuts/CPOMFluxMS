In the litter experiment S\textsubscript{R} ranged between 0.81 and 1.48 over the course of the experiment with a mean ($\pm$ SD) of 1.06 ($\pm$ 0.10).  The linear mixed model found that there was a significant effect of the presence of leaf litter on S\textsubscript{R} but this effect was not consistent throughout the incubation as indicated by a significant interaction between leaf litter and incubation days (Table \ref{tab:spec_stats}). Evaluation of the results shows that the bottles containing leaf litter had a greater S\textsubscript{R} on the initial day of the incubation but after this, there was no difference in S\textsubscript{R} among the bottles (Fig. \ref{fig:sratio_day}).

In the leached litter experiment  we measured S\textsubscript{R} values over a similar range to what was observed in the litter experiment. S\textsubscript{R} ranged from 0.85 to 1.27 with a mean ($\pm$ SD) of 1.04 ($\pm$ 0.07).  As in the litter experiment there was a significant effect of the presence of leaf litter on S\textsubscript{R}, but unlike in the leached litter experiment S\textsubscript{R} also varied with the length of the incubation, and had only a marginally significant interaction between leaf litter and incubation length (Table \ref{tab:spec_stats}). Evaluation of the data show that S\textsubscript{R} increased with incubation day and only on day 9 was there an increase in S\textsubscript{R} in the microcosms containing leaf litter (Fig. \ref{fig:sratio_day}).
