\subsection{Coarse Particulate Matter Density}

The density of CPOM in the ponds ranged between 3.44 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-1}. The CPOM density of the littoral portions of the ponds ranged between 9.71 and 1179.0 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} with a median density of 112.6 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2}, which is greater and much more variable than the CPOM density of the open areas of the ponds, which ranged between 3.44 and 214.9, with a median of 10.83 g AFDM m\textsuperscript{-2} (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}). Lancer Park Pond had the greatest and most variable CPOM density in both the open and littoral portions of the pond but this pond also had the fewest samples (Fig. \ref{fig:CPOM_density}).
