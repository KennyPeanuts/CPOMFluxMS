\subsection{Organic C and N}

The percent carbon of the surface sediments ranged between 3.05\% and 3.41\% with a median of 3.18\%.  The bulk sediments ranged between 3.12 and 4.27 \% C with a median of 3.29 \%.  The difference between the bulk sediment \% carbon and the surface sediment \% carbon was small with a range of --0.13 to 1.13 \% and a median of 0.09\%. Only 3 samples departed more than 0.5\% C and in all of these the bulk sediment had greater \% C. The bulk and surface sediment \% C of the same bottle were uncorrelated (r = -0.12) and the leaf litter or nutrient additions had no effect on the \% C of either the surface or bulk sediment.

The \% N of the bulk and surface sediments showed the same patterns as the \% C.  The \% N of the surface sediments ranged
