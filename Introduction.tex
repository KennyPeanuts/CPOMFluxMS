\section{Introduction}
Ecosystem subsidies, the movement of resources across ecosystem boundries \cite{Polis_1997}, are an important part of organic matter cycling in aquatic systems. The reciprical transfer of resources between aquatic and terrestrial systems is common \cite{Nakano_2001}, however the input of terrestrial organic matter to aquatic systems supports the metabolism and secondary production of the majority of lentic and lotic ecosystems\cite{Marcarelli_2011}. Organic matter subsidies from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems are dominated by detrital plant material either as dissolved (DOC) or particulate (POC) organic carbon, which can represent a substantial augmentation of autochthonous organic matter production \cite{Hodkinson_1975,GASITH_1976,wetzel_1984,WETZEL_1995,Webster_1997,Kobayashi_2011,Mehring_2014}.   

The direct input of DOC dominates terrestrial subsidies in most aquatic systems \cite{Rich_1978,wetzel_1984,CITE} but POC inputs, mainly in the form of leaf litter, can substantially augment aquatic organic matter pools \cite{Wetzel_1972,Hodkinson_1975,GASITH_1976,Rich_1978,Wallace_1999,Mehring_2014}. During the process of leaf litter decomposition in aquatic systems, leaves supply distinct subsidies to aquatic systems \cite{Gessner_1999,Marcarelli_2011}. Up to 30\% of the initial mass of leaves can be leached as DOC \cite{CITE,Meyer_1998,Duan_2014}, although large initial DOC fluxes from dried leaves may be an artifact of the drying process (CITE). This supply of DOC is an important component of aquatic organic matter budgets \cite{McDowell_1976,Karlsson_2007} and has been shown to alter the abundance \cite{Bott_1984,Fey_2015} and function \cite{MCCONNELL_1968} of aquatic microbial communities. Furthermore, DOC subsidies processed through the microbial loop support metazoan production \cite{Hall_1998,Wilcox_2005,Fey_2015b}.  The leaf mass that remains following leaching can be transferred directly to the biomass of aquatic invertebrate \cite{Wallace_1999,Kobayashi_2011} and vertebrate \cite{Rubbo_2008} consumers via consumption of the leaf material \cite{Gessner_1999}. 

The majority of research on leaf litter additions to aquatic systems has focused on its impact on microbial and metazoan production, however the process of leaf litter decomposition also alters the chemical and physical environment of aquatic systems \cite{Gessner_1999}. Leaf leachates reduce light penetration \cite{CITE} and alter pH \cite{CITE}. Furthermore leachates provide bioavailable organic nutrients \cite{McConnell_1968,Duan_2014} and have been shown to increase total phosphorus \cite{Feh_2015b}, and total nitrogen \cite{Feh_2015} concentration in overlying water. Mineralization of leaf organic matter by microbial or animal consumers, results in the release of inorganic nutrients and CO\textsubscript{2} \cite{CITE} from the leaf mass. Typically, however, the stoichometric imbalance between microbial consumers and detritus means that leaves are sites of net immobilization of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus \cite{CITE}. The mineralization of organic carbon in the leaves creates a demand for oxygen \cite{CITE} that can lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in water overlying decomposing leaf litter \cite{Hodkinson_1975,Rubbo_2008,Mehring_2014,Feh_2015b}.

These alterations to the physical environment associated with leaf decomposition have the potential to... BIG QUESTION

TRANSTION TO SMALL QUESTION

Although leaf litter represents an important subsidy in both lentic and lotic systems \cite{Webster_1986}, the physical differences between these systems will likely alter the specific effects of leaf litter on ecosystem function. The redistribution of sediments and other materials in lotic systems tends to be more variable and extensive than in lentic systems \cite{Wetzel_2001}. Furthermore, the sedimens of lakes tend to accumulate material...

Within lentic systems, there are important differences between natural and man--made systems, particularly for the smallest lakes and ponds. The abundance of small (< 0.1 km\textsuperscript{2}) lakes is greater than 2 orders of magnitude greater than even lakes with a surface area of 1 km\textsuperscript{2} \cite{2010} and the cumulative surface area 

In this study we evaluate the effect that leaf litter subsidies have on nutrient cycling and sediment oxygen demand in the sediments of a small man--made pond. We hypothesize that leaf litter will 1) increase sediment oxygen demand, 2) increase DOC concentration and bioavaliablity, and 3) decrease the flux of DIN and DIP from the sediments. We further hypothesize that sediments with leaf litter with have greater fungal biomass and sediment organic matter than sediments without leaf litter.
