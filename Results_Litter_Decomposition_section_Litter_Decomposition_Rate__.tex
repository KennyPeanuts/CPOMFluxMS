\subsection{Litter Decomposition Rate}

 The litter bags were deployed in Daulton Pond, Campus Pond, and Lancer Park Pond for 211, 209, and 204 days respectively. At the end of these incubations there was 39\%, 31\%, and 24\% of the original 5 g of leaf mass remaining in Daulton Pond, Campus Pond, and Lancer Park Pond, respectively. The three ponds had similar decay coefficients (k) but Daulton Pond had the lowest rate at 0.0025 d\textsuperscript{-1}, followed by Lancer Park Pond and Campus pond with rates of 0.0035 and 0.0030 d\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively.
