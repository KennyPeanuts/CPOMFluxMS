\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

Differences in CPOM density among ponds and , between the littoral and open water zones of all ponds was determined using Kruskal Wallace rank sum tests. The relationship between CPOM density and the percent organic matter of the sediments was assessed using Pearson correlation.

The decay coefficent for the leaves in the litter bags in each pond were determined by calculating the slope of the relationship between the natural log of the percent leaf mass remaining by the number of days in the pond.

In the litter experiment and leached litter experiment differences in the mass loss of the leaves in the different treatment levels over the course of the experiment was tested using ANOVA. Changes in the percent C and percent N of the leaves in the different treatment levels of the litter and leached litter experiments was assessed with Kruskal Wallace rank sum tests, however the changes in leaf C and N mass among treatments in the leached litter experiment were assesses with ANOVA. In the litter experiment, the difference between the area-normalized ergosterol mass of the leaves and the surface sediments was tested with a Kruskal Wallace rank sum test.

The effect of days of incubation, and treatment levels on SOD (litter and leached litter SOD experiments), nutrient flux (litter experiment), and S\textsubscript{R} (litter and leached litter experiments) was assessed with a linear mixed models using the lme4 package in R.

All statistical analysis was performed using R \cite{R}
