\subsection{Litter Decomposition Rate}

Litter bags were deployed in Daulton Pond, Campus Pond, and Lancer Park Pond for 211, 209, and 204 days respectively. At the end of these incubations  the mean ($\pm$ SD) percent of  the original 5 g of leaf mass remaining in Daulton Pond, Campus Pond, and Lancer Park Pond was 45.3 \% ($\pm$ 4.7 \%), 42.3 \% ($\pm$ 8.2 \%), 43.2 \% ($\pm$ 8.3 \%), respectively. The three ponds had similar decay coefficients (k) but Daulton Pond had the lowest rate at 0.0025 d\textsuperscript{-1}, followed by Lancer Park Pond and Campus pond with rates of 0.0035 and 0.0030 d\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively.
