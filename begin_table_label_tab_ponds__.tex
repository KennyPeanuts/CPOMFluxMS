\caption{Descriptions of the ponds used in the study. Maximum Z is the maximum depth ever recorded in the lake. Surface Area is calculated using the digitized outline of the lake in ARC--GIS. Secchi Z is a representative Secchi depth recorded during the growing season. And Days Litter Bags Incubated is a list of the days the litter bags were in the water before being retrieved for those ponds used in the litter decomposition experiment.}
