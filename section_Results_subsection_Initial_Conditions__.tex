\section{Results}
\subsection{Initial Conditions}
The sediments added to the mesocosms had an estimated dry bulk density that ranged between 0.25 to 0.26 g ml\textsuperscript{-1} and an organic matter content between 12.7 and 12.9\%. Using this information, we estimate that the sediments in the mesocosms contained between 3.16 and 3.33 g of organic matter.  The mesocosms that received leaf litter each received between 0.04 and 0.08 additional g of organic matter with the added leaf litter, which would be the equivelent of 11.3 to 22.7 g coarse organic matter m\textsuperscript{-2}. In the lake from which the sediments were collected we measured between 57.3 and 163.0 g coarse organic matter m\textsuperscript{-2}, so the mesocosms used in the experiment contained at most 40\% of the coarse organic matter of the lake.

The lake water added to the experiment initially (10 June 2014), had 0.034, 0.084, and 0.008 mg L\textsuperscript{-1} of NO\textsubscript{2}--N + NO\textsubscript{3}--N, NH\textsubscript{4}--N, and ortho-phosphate, respectively. The bottles enriched with DIN and DIP had 0.184, 0.195, and 0.012 mg L\textsuperscript{-1} NO\textsubscript{2}--N + NO\textsubscript{3}--N, NH\textsubscript{4}--N, and ortho-phosphate, respectively.
